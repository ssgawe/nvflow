# Contributing to NVFlow

Thank you for your interest in contributing to NVFlow.

## Signing Your Work

We require that all contributors **sign off** on their commits. This certifies that the contribution is your original work, or that you have the right to submit it under the same license (or a compatible license).

**Any contribution that contains commits that are not signed off will not be accepted.**

### How to sign off

Use the `--signoff` (or `-s`) option when committing your changes:

```bash
git commit -s -m "Add cool feature."
```

This will append a line to your commit message, for example:

```
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
```

### Full text of the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

The sign-off certifies compliance with the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO). Full text: [https://developercertificate.org/](https://developercertificate.org/)
