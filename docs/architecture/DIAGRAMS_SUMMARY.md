## 🔄 Keeping Diagrams Updated

When updating the codebase:

1. **Adding a new recipe:**
   - Update `architecture-overview.mmd` (Recipe Layer section)
   - Consider creating a new pipeline diagram (like `finance-pipeline.mmd`)

2. **Adding a new stage:**
   - Update recipe-specific pipeline diagram
   - Update `component-architecture.mmd` if it's a new pattern

3. **Changing core framework:**
   - Update `component-architecture.mmd`
   - Update `execution-flow.mmd` if execution logic changes
   - Update `ARCHITECTURE.md` with detailed explanations

4. **Infrastructure changes:**
   - Update `deployment-architecture.mmd`
   - Update cluster setup documentation

5. **Major architectural changes:**
   - Review and update all diagrams
