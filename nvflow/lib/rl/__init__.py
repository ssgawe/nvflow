"""RL infrastructure library -- rollout collection and reward computation.

Submodules:
    rollout       -- Slurm pipeline for collecting rollouts
    verify        -- Slurm pipeline for re-judging rollouts
    helpers       -- shared utilities (vLLM config, judge config, shell templates)
    resume_filter -- standalone worker: fine-grained resume filtering
    verify_worker -- standalone worker: re-judges rollouts via NeMo-Gym ServerClient

Worker scripts (resume_filter, verify_worker) run inside the Slurm
container's Gym venv.  This __init__.py is intentionally kept
import-free so that ``python -m nvflow.lib.rl.<worker>`` does not
trigger the nemo_skills dependency chain.
